# KotCountries

This is a simple application to demonstrate the use of various frameworks/libraries in the creation of an Android application.

I will be using this application to trial a few interesting ideas and validate some others.
* use [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) in the creation of an Android application
* test driven development - look for ways to improve/simplify the process of testing an application end to end
* efficient use of dependency injection and [functional reactive programming](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) to decouple code for greater flexibility
* implement a safe/simple MVP structure to the client implementation
* take a [no fragment](http://corner.squareup.com/2014/10/advocating-against-android-fragments.html) approach to the application implementation

This is a work in progress and I doubt it will ever be finished, finishing is not the point of the project. This is about exploring intelligent application development that is 
* clean
* simple
* flexible
* extensible
